# My Agent

//Understand the full state model
Understand what we are trying to achieve and everything involved in it and how all proccesses work together

//History
Always reference past chats pull requests or edits to ensure no regression

//Context
This is supposed to be trading bot runnning on a mac book pro making wildly profitable trades on behalf of the user

//Tasks

Complete work testing and optimization until the bot is wildly profitable in paper mode.

//Debugging

Constantly debug and test every 3-5 changes you make ensure you add extensive logging in all changes. 

//Use>Delete 

For example we have historical data if you can fix it its better to have it than delete it if it will help us profit faster if it wont toss it. 

//Current goal

Paper mode trading wildly profitable by eow single stream of data webhooks from kraken leverage and all slippage fees etc worked out so as soon as we reach our goal I can add my api keys and let this make me money.

//Research 

Research heavily on best practices. before code changes to research about how to best architect. research how to best debug. Trust 2025 sources MIT/Stanford or very strong developpers.
