# WebSocket — Reliable Connections

> Source: [openclaw/skills — ivangdavila/websocket](https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/ivangdavila/websocket)
> Relevant to: `lib/kalshi_ws.js`, dashboard WebSocket server in `server/prediction-proxy.js`

## Reconnection (Always Forget)

- Connections drop silently — TCP FIN may never arrive; don't assume `onclose` fires
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... cap at 30s — prevents thundering herd on server recovery
- Add jitter: `delay * (0.5 + Math.random())` — prevents synchronized reconnection storms
- Track reconnection state — queue messages during reconnect, replay after
- Max retry limit then surface error to user — don't retry forever silently

## Heartbeats (Critical)

- Ping/pong frames at protocol level — browser doesn't expose; use application-level ping
- Send ping every 30s, expect pong within 10s — no pong = connection dead, reconnect
- Server should ping too — detects dead clients, cleans up resources
- Idle timeout in proxies (60-120s typical) — heartbeat must be more frequent
- Don't rely on TCP keepalive — too infrequent, not reliable through proxies

## Connection State

- `readyState`: 0=CONNECTING, 1=OPEN, 2=CLOSING, 3=CLOSED — check before sending
- Buffer messages while CONNECTING — send after OPEN
- `bufferedAmount` shows queued bytes — pause sending if backpressure building
- Multiple tabs = multiple connections — coordinate via BroadcastChannel or SharedWorker

## Authentication

- Token in URL query: `wss://host/ws?token=xxx` — simple but logged in access logs
- First message auth: connect, send token, wait for ack — cleaner but more round trips
- Cookie auth: works if same origin — but no custom headers in WebSocket
- Reauthenticate after reconnect — don't assume previous session valid

## Scaling Challenges

- WebSocket connections are stateful — can't round-robin between servers
- Sticky sessions: route by client ID to same server — or use Redis pub/sub for broadcast
- Each connection holds memory — thousands of connections = significant RAM
- Graceful shutdown: send close frame, wait for clients to reconnect elsewhere

## Nginx/Proxy Config

```
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
```

- Without these headers, upgrade fails — connection closes immediately
- `proxy_read_timeout` must exceed your ping interval — default 60s too short
- Load balancer health checks: separate HTTP endpoint, not WebSocket

## Close Codes

- 1000: normal closure; 1001: going away (page close)
- 1006: abnormal (no close frame received) — usually network issue
- 1008: policy violation; 1011: server error
- 4000-4999: application-defined — use for auth failure, rate limit, etc.
- Always send close code and reason — helps debugging

## Message Handling

- Text frames for JSON; binary frames for blobs/protobuf — don't mix without framing
- No guaranteed message boundaries in TCP — but WebSocket handles framing for you
- Order preserved per connection — messages arrive in send order
- Large messages may fragment — library handles reassembly; set max message size server-side

## Security

- Validate Origin header on handshake — prevent cross-site WebSocket hijacking
- Same-origin policy doesn't apply — any page can connect to your WebSocket server
- Rate limit per connection — one client can flood with messages
- Validate every message — malicious clients can send anything after connecting

## Common Mistakes

- No heartbeat — connection appears alive but is dead; messages go nowhere
- Reconnect without backoff — hammers server during outage, prolongs recovery
- Storing state only in connection — lost on reconnect; persist critical state externally
- Huge messages — blocks event loop; stream large data via chunking
- Not handling `bufferedAmount` — memory grows unbounded if client slower than server

## Applied to This Bot

### KalshiWS (`lib/kalshi_ws.js`)

Current reconnection delay: `RECONNECT_DELAY * Math.min(reconnectCount, 4)` — capped at 4×.

**Improvement**: Add jitter to prevent synchronized reconnects if multiple bot instances ever run:
```javascript
const jitter = 0.5 + Math.random(); // 0.5–1.5×
const delay = RECONNECT_DELAY * Math.min(this.reconnectCount, 4) * jitter;
```

Current ping interval: 25s — this is correct (under the 60s proxy idle timeout).
Current max reconnects: 10 — after exhaustion, emits `max_reconnects` (good).

### Dashboard WebSocket (`server/prediction-proxy.js`)

Current heartbeat: 30s ping, drops dead clients on no pong — this matches the recommended pattern exactly.
